# ECON 235 Project 2 — Applied Statistical Programming with R

This project was completed as part of **ECON 235: Data Analysis for Economics** at [Your University Name].

It applies key statistical programming concepts using **R** and **Quarto** to explore real-world data and theoretical simulations. The project demonstrates skills in data visualization, statistical analysis, and reproducible research.

## Topics Covered

- **Set Theory** (with Star Wars character data — UpSet plots)
- **Expectation and Variance** (Binomial distribution)
- **Conditional Expectations** (Simulation using standard normal distribution)
- **Central Limit Theorem** (Custom distribution, simulation, and visualization)

## Tools & Packages Used

- **R**
- **Quarto (.qmd)**
- **ggplot2** (data visualization)
- **dplyr** (data wrangling)
- **ComplexUpset** (advanced visualization)
- **tidyr** and **tibble** (data handling)

## Files

- `ECON_235_Project2.pdf` — Rendered report
- `Homework1.qmd` — Source code (.qmd)

## Summary

This project builds proficiency in **applied statistical programming**, **data visualization**, and **reproducible economic data analysis**. It serves as part of my portfolio for future graduate studies and professional work in economics, data analysis, and business analytics.
